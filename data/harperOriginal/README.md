The data used in this manuscript builds off of Peroxiredoxin subgroup annotation data
made available in the following publication:

Harper AF, Leuthaeuser JB, Babbitt PC, Morris JH, Ferrin TE, Poole LB, Fetrow JS. 
An atlas of peroxiredoxins created using an active site profile-based approach to 
functionally relevant clustering of proteins.
*PLoS Computational Biology*. 2017 Feb 10;13(2):e1005284.

The Supplementary Information S2 File associated with that manuscript
was used as the basis of the sequence datasets in our work. That file is available at: 
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005284.s011
and is described as: 
"An Excel file containing all sequences identified with DASP2 search scores â‰¤1e-14 
in the final MISST search following cross-hit analysis."

The canonical Prx subgroup motifs were extracted from the text of the Harper paper.
Figure 5 of the Harper also provides significant information on subgroup relevant motifs.
